		<h2>NASA Poster</h2>
		<p>Worked under Tra-my Justine Richardson in the Bioengineering Branch 
		to develop a novel carbon-dioxide removal system. Was responsible for 
		adapting existing bench-scale system for new carbon dioxide beds being 
		developed for the MultiSORB initiative. Also gained experience conducting 
		tests on heat pipes and creating custom paste formulations.</p>

		<h2>Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) Poster</h2>
		<p>Collaborated with Dr. Siyuan Xing to develop a machine learning architecture 
		to learn the Lagrangian from measurement data. Embedded the Euler-Lagrange 
		equation into a loss function. Produced a data pipeline to streamline 
		simulation, training and validation. Gained experience working with 
		scientific computing tools such as TensorFlow and Sympy</p>

		<h2>Autonomous Line-following Robot Project</h2>
		robotics</p>
		<p>Developed an autonomous line-following robot using the Romi kit from Polulu.
		Integrated closed-loop motor control, line-following, real time data streaming, 
		and state estimation using a cooperative multi-tasking framework. Gained 
		experience interfacing with microntroller, managing finite resources, 
		and troubleshooting a number of hardware/software issues.
